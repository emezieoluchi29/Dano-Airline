**‚úàÔ∏è Dano Airlines Passenger Satisfaction Analysis**

This repository contains my capstone project with Digitaley Drive, where I analyzed passenger satisfaction data for Dano Airlines (a UK-based airline). The analysis was performed in Power BI using SQL-transformed data.
üìâ Challenge: Dano Airlines‚Äô customer satisfaction dipped below 50% for the first time. As the analyst, I was tasked to identify root causes and provide actionable recommendations to improve satisfaction.
